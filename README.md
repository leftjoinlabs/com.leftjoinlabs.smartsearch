# Smart Search

Smart Search is a [CiviCRM](https://civicrm.org) extension which greatly speeds up the task of identifying, creating, and updating single contact records.

## Use cases 

 
* You want to **copy-paste someone’s entire email signature** into a search field and get to their contact record with one click.
* You want to view a frequently-used contact record and get there with **minimal keystrokes**.
* You found the right contact in your search, but it’s missing some of the info you have. You want to **quickly add the missing info** to the contact before choosing it.
* If you can’t find a contact, you want to keep entering more info to search in **several fields in parallel**, so that even if some important fields have typos, you can still find the contact if it exists.
* You searched for someone and determined they’re not in the database. Now you’d like to **use the text you already entered to create a new contact**.


| Smart Search **is** for these cases | Smart Search is **not** for these cases |
| -- | -- |
| I have a single, specific, real-life person¹ in my mind, and I want to get to an updated contact record for this one person | I don’t have a specific real-life person¹ in-mind, but I have some criteria, and I’d like to find all the contacts which match this criteria. |

*¹ or household or organization*

Think of Smart Search as a very powerful contact chooser.
